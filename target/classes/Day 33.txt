Create testing.xml
------------------

Choose the test class by Shift + click -> Right-click -> TestNG -> Convert to TestNg

Data Provider:
	To perform data driven testing

Test data:
	1. Static data -> maintain data in property file or use parameter tag in testing.xml
	2. Dynamic data -> Excel

Assertions:
	Helps us to verify the condition of the test and decide whether the test has passed or failed.

2 types:
	Hard assertion
		-> If there are any failure it will not proceed further and it stop the execution

		Assert.assertTrue(true): -> looks for true condition, in case of false test case will be marked as fail
		Assert.assertFalse(false); -> looks for false condition, in case of true, test will be marked as fail
		Assert.assertEquals(actualText,expectText)-> if the expected and actual are matching then the test will be passed.
	
	Soft assertion 
		-> If there are any failures, it will still execute all lines of code and in the end it will notify the failure.

		SoftAssert asserObj = new SoftAssert();
		asserObj.assertTrue(true);
		asserObj.assertFalse(false);
		asserObj.assertEquals(actualText,expectText); 
		asserObj.assertAll(); -> should be mentioned in the end.
